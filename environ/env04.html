<h2> <span class = "ti1"> What is this place?</span></h2>

<p>
Nothing much, not yet at least. This is just ground zero for a<br> 
series of future projects set in the fictional country of Yohuala.<br>
A place more real than one might initially think.<br>

This is one of the many lakes that make up the remnants of lake Atoccan. Located just 10 miles east of the country's capital.
The lake has been drained for the past few centuries since the Spanish conquest. Now all<br>
that remains are a series of swamps, rivers, and small lakes dotted around the land.<br>

This is one of the most important ports in all of Yohuala. As the majority of our <br>
imports enter through this single port. Everything abroad enters here.<br>
Goods, services, ships, people, faiths, armies, nations, flags, ..... Everything comes here.<br>
Todos vengan aqu√≠<br>

        This image looks over the valley of the state of Mistipac<br>
        It's currently the dry season, so the dense fog that usually blankets the state is
        scarce. It is tied with Chiatepez for having the largest
        indigenous population in the whole country. Which includes large indigenous groups
        like the Yacatecos and Apoctecos.
