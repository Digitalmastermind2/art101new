    <h2> The world is yours </h2>

Suede Timbs on my feets makes my cipher complete<br>
Whether cruisin' in a Sikh's cab or Montero Jeep<br>
I can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep<br>
I keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep<br>
<p>I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)<br>
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)<br>
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me<br></p>

<h2> N.Y. State of Mind </h2>

The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps<br>
That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks<br>
I'm a addict for sneakers, 20's of Buddha and bitches with beepers<br>
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya<br>
Inhale deep like the words of my breath<br>
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death<br>
I lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times<br>
Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind<br>
